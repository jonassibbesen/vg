/** Use a .vg file on disk with a .vgi index to provide random access to the
 * graph data without loading the entire graph into memory. Sort of a
 * compromise between an XG and a VG, except unlike either we don't need the
 * whole graph in memory.
 *
 * We require that all nodes in the graph appear in ID order within their
 * chunks, and that all chunks appear in ID order. So all nodes are in ID order
 * in the file.
 *
 * Cannot be copied since internally it contains a ProtobufIterator wrapping an
 * open file. Can only be moved.
 *
 * All operations are thread-safe to call. Internally we can't be seeking a
 * cursor off to another location in the middle of looping over a run of
 * matchung chunks, but we handle that ourselves.
 *
 * Internally, we keep a pool of cursors into the backing graph file, and each
 * time we need to actually access the backing graph file we grab a cursor or
 * make one if we don't have a free one.
 *
 * Internally we also keep a least-recently-used cache of indexed
 * merged-together graph groups. The cache is keyed by group start VO. The
 * cache holds shared pointers to cache entries, so that one thread can be
 * evicting something from the cache while another is still working with it.
